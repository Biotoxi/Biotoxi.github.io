  <h1>Its raining cats and dogs!</h1>
  <p>In a local neighborhood cats and dogs were seen falling from trees, what a strange occurrence.</p>
  <h2>Why are cats and dogs in trees?</h2>
  <p>Cats and Dogs are being found in trees because of the local supervillain Dr. Evil. Dr. Evil unleashed a ray onto the local neighborhoods last night that made all of the Cats and Dogs residing in the neighborhood run up into the trees just outside of their homes.</p>
  <h2>What can you do about this disturbance</h2>
  <p>Dr. Evil stated that <q>Cats and dogs will remain in trees until I have received a pineapple at my doorstep</q>. Dr. Evil must have a strange addiction to <strong>pineapples</strong> if this is all he is asking for.</p>
