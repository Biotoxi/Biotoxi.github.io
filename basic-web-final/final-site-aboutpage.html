            <h1>How will I apply what I learned after I graduate?</h1>
        </br>
            <p>Due to the events I run being some of the most dificult in the sport it builds my endurance. Im going into the military after I graduate and will reguarly work out in my free time since it will be one of the few things I will be able to do [I will be on a Submarine with no wifi so i wont be able to play majority of videogames] and the endurance I built will make it easier for me to transition into body building.</p>

            <p>When im in the military I will build even more endurance and hopefully the endurance I had from the years of track and other sports will make bootcamp easier.</p>
