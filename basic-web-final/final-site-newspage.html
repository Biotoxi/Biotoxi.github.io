            <h1>Why am I in track</h1>

            <div>
               <p>Its simple, my father was in track when he was in highschool and he suggested that I did track aswell so Im doing it to make him proud. </p>

               <p>Additionally I will be going into the military after highschool and I belive that this can be used as conditioning for bootcamp so the physical side of that isnt as hard.</p>

               <p>Another valuable reason why im in track is because of friends. Many of my good friends are in Track aswell so naturally I would use this as an exuse to hang out with them outside of school.</p>
